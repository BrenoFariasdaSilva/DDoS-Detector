Genetic Algorithm Feature Selection & Analysis
================================================================================
Author      : Breno Farias da Silva
Created     : 2025-10-07
Description :
   This script runs a DEAP-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) to perform feature
   selection for classification problems. It provides an end-to-end pipeline:
   dataset loading and cleaning, scaling, GA setup and execution, candidate
   evaluation (with a Random Forest base estimator), and post-hoc analysis
   (RFE ranking correlation, CSV summaries and boxplot visualizations).

   Key features include:
      - DEAP-based GA for binary-mask feature selection
      - Fitness evaluation using a RandomForest and returning multi-metrics
        (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, FPR, FNR, elapsed time)
      - Population sweep support (run GA over a range of population sizes)
      - Integration with previously-computed RFE rankings for cross-checking
      - Exports: best-subset text file, CSV summaries and per-feature boxplots
      - Progress bars via tqdm and safe filename handling for outputs
      - Cross-platform completion notification (optional sound)

Usage:
   1. Configure the dataset:
      - Edit the `csv_file` variable in the `main()` function to point to
         the CSV dataset you want to analyze (the script assumes the last
         column is the target and numeric features are used).
   2. Optionally tune GA parameters in `main()` or call sites:
      - n_generations, min_pop, max_pop, population_size, train_test_ratio
   3. Run the pipeline via the project's Makefile:
      $ make main
      (Makefile is expected to setup env / deps and execute this script.)
   NOTE:
      - If you prefer not to use the Makefile, you can run the module/script
        directly from Python in your dev environment, but the recommended
        workflow for the project is `make main`.

Outputs:
   - Feature_Analysis/Genetic_Algorithm_results.txt  (best subset + RFE cross-info)
   - Feature_Analysis/<dataset>_feature_summary.csv  (mean/std per class for selected features)
   - Feature_Analysis/<dataset>-<feature>.png         (boxplots for top features)
   - Console summary of best subsets per population size (when sweeping)

TODOs:
   - Add CLI argument parsing (argparse) to avoid editing `main()` for different runs.
   - Add cross-validation or nested CV to make fitness evaluation more robust.
   - Support multi-objective optimization (e.g., F1 vs. model training time).
   - Parallelize individual evaluations (joblib / dask) to speed up GA fitness calls.
   - Save and version best individuals (pickle/JSON) and GA run metadata.
   - Implement reproducible seeding across DEAP, numpy, random and sklearn.
   - Add automatic handling of categorical features and missing-value imputation.
   - Add early stopping and convergence checks to the GA loop.
   - Produce a machine-readable summary (JSON) of final metrics and selected features.
   - Add unit tests for core functions (fitness evaluation, GA setup, I/O).

Dependencies:
   - Python >= 3.9
   - pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, deap, tqdm, matplotlib, seaborn, colorama

Assumptions & Notes:
   - Dataset format: CSV, last column = target. Only numeric features are used.
   - RFE results (if present) are read from `Feature_Analysis/RFE_results_RandomForestClassifier.txt`.
   - Sound notification is skipped on Windows by default.
   - The script uses RandomForestClassifier as the default evaluator; change as needed.
   - Inspect output directories (`Feature_Analysis/`) after runs for artifacts.
