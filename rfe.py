Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) Automation and Feature Analysis Tool
================================================================================
Author      : Breno Farias da Silva
Created     : 2025-10-07
Description :
   This script automates the process of performing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
   on structured datasets to identify the most relevant features for classification tasks.
   It provides a fully integrated pipeline â€” from dataset loading and preprocessing
   to feature ranking, visualization, and export of analysis reports.

   Core functionalities include:
      - Dataset validation and safe file handling
      - Standardization of numeric features using z-score normalization
      - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest as the base estimator
      - Generation of ranked feature lists with visual and statistical summaries
      - Boxplot-based visualization of top features by class distribution
      - Cross-platform sound notification upon completion

Usage:
   1. Set the `csv_file` variable inside the `main()` function to the dataset path.
   2. Run the script using:
      $ make main
   3. The program will automatically:
      - Load and clean the dataset
      - Run RFE to select the most relevant features
      - Save results and visualizations to the `Feature_Analysis/` directory
      - Optionally play a notification sound when finished

Output:
   - Text report (`RFE_results_<Model>.txt`) summarizing feature rankings.
   - CSV summary of top features with mean and standard deviation per class.
   - Boxplot visualizations for each selected feature stored in `Feature_Analysis/`.

TODOs:
   - Add support for additional estimators (e.g., SVM, Gradient Boosting).
   - Integrate evaluation metrics (F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall, FPR, FNR)
     directly after feature selection.
   - Incorporate correlation analysis to remove redundant features.
   - Extend preprocessing to handle categorical and missing data automatically.
   - Implement CLI argument parsing for dataset paths and configuration options.
   - Add parallel RFE runs with different feature subset sizes (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25).

Dependencies:
   - Python >= 3.9
   - pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, colorama

Notes:
   - The last column of the dataset is assumed to be the target variable.
   - Only numeric columns are considered for RFE processing.
   - Sound playback is skipped on Windows platforms by default.
